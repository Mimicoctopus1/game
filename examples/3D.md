# 3D renderer:
For 3D rendering, I use a custom renderer that is as simple as possible, with many plugins. It may, however, be confusing if you don't understand a vector. A vector is basically an object with 3 properties: x, y, and z. These properties give the vectors position in 3D space.

So let's say my camera is here, and I want to see this triangle in 3D.

Why a triangle? Because you can make any geometrical shape out of triangles! Take this cat face for example:

Anyways, this program is an example of a raytracer. A ray tracer works basically by simulating light like so:

Light comes from somewhere, bounces off of an object, and goes to the camera... kind of. Do you notice how much light actually never actually gets to the camera? The solution works by instead sending rays from the camera out, and seeing if they bounce to a light source. This way, everything ends up at the camera. There are still some rays that never meet the object or a light source, but they can go on further until they do reach an object.

Next is how to detect if a ray actually collides with a triangle. A triangle must rest on a plane, so first let's detect collision with a plane.
